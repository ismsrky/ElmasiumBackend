# The backend of 'Elmasium'

This is the whole back end directory of 'Elmasium'.

There are business, dto, poco and rest api classes.
There are also two independent console applications in order to send emails and sms.
And of course there are some util classes and applications like image compress and import.

Completely written in C#. I wrote the all projects here except 'websocket-sharp'.
